TCAM is my take on building an app like Instagram. TCAM uses the Core Image features provided in the iOS 5 framework to create filters. For current and upcoming features check out the details below: 

<b>Current Version: </b> 

- Take pictures using your iPhone camera
- Apply filters to the picture 


<b>Future Features: </b>

- Share pictures on Twitter 
- Share pictures on Facebook
